Here's a basic format you can use to write an email to your wife expressing your love:
My Love for You
Dear My Love,
I hope this email finds you well
I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me. You bring so much joy and love into my life, and I feel so grateful to have you by my side. [You can mention some specific things that you appreciate about your wife and what she means to you].
I hope this email lets you know how much I love you and how grateful I am to have you in my life. [Mention a shared memory or moment that is special to both of you].
With love, Sijun
This format should give you a good starting point to write a heartfelt email to your wife, but feel free to personalize it as much as you'd like. The most important thing is to express your love and appreciation for her in a sincere and meaningful way.
